Devops = Development + operations
it's a culture + set of practices + told that help
   . Developers: who write code
   . Operations: who deploy/manage systems

work together, instead of working silos
Real  time Examples:
 Imagine you're building a mobile app like Swiggy
      . The developers writes codes to add "Track My Orders" features
      . Without DevOps: Developers gives code to Ops team+ they manually deploy+ bugs happens+ delays
      . With DevOps: Code is automatically tested and deployed+ customers get updates faster and safety
